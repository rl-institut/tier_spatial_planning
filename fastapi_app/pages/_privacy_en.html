    of this data is done voluntarily. The use and payment of all services offered is - as far as technically possible
    and reasonable - also permitted without providing such data or by providing anonymous data or a pseudonym. The use
    of contact data such as postal addresses, telephone and fax numbers as well as email addresses published in the site

<h3>Subject of data privacy</h3>
<p>
    Data privacy addresses issues concerning personal data. According to Article 4 no. 1 of the General Data Protection
    Regulation (GDPR), these are data referring to an identified or identifiable individual, in other words all data
    which could be used to identify you. This applies to data such as your name, private address, email address, and
    telephone number but also to usage data such as your IP address.
</p>
<p>
    As a matter of course Technische Universität Berlin observes the legal requirements of data privacy and other
    applicable regulations.
</p>
<p>
    We are committed to ensuring that you can trust us concerning your personal data. For this reason transfers of
    personal or sensitive data are encrypted. In addition, our websites are protected by technical measures against
    damage or unauthorized access.

<h3>General data privacy</h3>
<p>
<ol>
    <li>When you visit the TU Berlin website or download data from its web pages, the following information is saved in
        a log file:<br> -&nbsp;IP address of yor device,<br> -&nbsp;the date and time you accessed the site,<br> -&nbsp;the
        web page you visited or name of the downloaded file,<br> -&nbsp;the amount of transferred data,<br> -&nbsp;the
        “user agent-string” of your web browser,<br> -&nbsp;the website from which you were referred to the current web
        page or file and<br> -&nbsp;a status notification of successful or unsuccessful access.<br> Non-depersonalized
        data will be deleted after two weeks and will not be stored.&nbsp;This data will only be used for non-commercial
        purposes: It will only be reviewed manually if necessary for error analysis, optimization or investigation of
        misuse or performance issues.<br> This represents a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. f
        EU-DSGVO. A right of objection according to Art. 21 EU-DSGVO is not possible due to lack of technical
        feasibility.
    </li>
    <li>In order to protect your transmitted data as best as possible, we use SSL encryption for any data transmission.
        You can recognize such encrypted connections by the prefix "https://" in the page link in the address line or by
        the green/closed lock symbol of your browser. Unencrypted pages are marked by "http://" or an open or red lock
        symbol.<br> All data that you transmit to this website - for example when making inquiries or logging in -
        cannot be read by third parties thanks to SSL encryption..
    </li>
    <li>Cookies are often additionally used for data collection and storage. Cookies are small data packets consisting
        of text that are stored by your web browser when you call up a website.<br> Cookies are used by us to enable you
        to make optimal use of the websites. They are never used to track personal user actions or for behavioral
        analysis. They are only used where they are technically necessary or more useful than other techniques (in the
        sense of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f EU-DSGVO): to record your login status, your consent to the display of external
        content (opt-in) and your deactivation of cookie-less Matomo tracking (opt-out). As a result, the use of the
        websites is mainly possible without the use of cookies. However, for functions or pages that require a login or
        password, cookies are technically necessary.<br> We use temporary and permanent cookies. Temporary cookies (also
        known&nbsp;as session cookies) are automatically deleted when you close your web browser. Permanent cookies, on
        the other hand, have a set lifetime. You can set your web browser to delete cookies that have already been
        placed.

<h3>Scope of data collection and storage</h3>
For information about how we handle personal traffic data, please refer to the “General data policy” section and the section on “Usage data”.</p>
<p>The active communication of your personal data is not required for the use of our websites - in order for TU Berlin
    to fulfill its service mandate, however, we require personal data in individual cases, the processing of which is
    carried out in accordance with Art. 6 (1) lit. a EU-DSGVO. This applies in particular to answering individual e-mail
    inquiries or ordering special services.<br> If you commission us to provide a service, we will generally only
    collect and store your personal data to the extent necessary for the provision of the service.</p><p>In exceptional
    cases, e.g. in the context of event registrations, you will be asked whether your data may be stored for the purpose
    of providing information on similar events that go beyond pure event management. In this case, your consent is
    voluntary; refusal will not result in any disadvantages for you.<br> At the TU Berlin, mailing lists are used as an
    instrument for the targeted distribution of information. If you have subscribed to one of our mailing lists with
    your e-mail address or have given your consent for this, we will use your e-mail address to inform you about
    important and new information until you unsubscribe or are removed from the list.</p><p><strong>You can revoke your
    consent at any time and without giving reasons and request the deletion of your data. You can request the latter by
    sending an e-mail to the institution holding the data.</strong>
<h3>Collection and storage of usage data</h3>
<h4>Log data</h4>
<p>
    To optimize our website, we store data such as the IP address of your device, the page accessed, the date and time
    of the page access, the page from which you accessed our site.&nbsp;<br> This data is held for error handling and to
    detect misuse attempts, automatically deleted after two weeks and not archived; permanent storage is excluded. This
    represents a legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f EU-DSGVO. A right of objection
    according to Art. 21 EU-DSGVO is not possible due to lack of technical feasibility.

<h4>OpenStreetMap (OSM)</h4>
Some of our web pages use a plugin to integrate maps. For this purpose, we use the “OpenStreetMap” (OSM) tool
<br> provided by the OpenStreetMap Foundation. When visiting a page with the embedded OSM plugin, a connection to the OpenStreetMap servers is established. The operators of OpenStreetMap receive information about which page with the OSM map you are currently viewing as well as your IP address. As the operator of
<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.tu.berlin/"
   target="_blank">https://www.tu.berlin/</a>, TU Berlin does not have any influence on this data transmission.</p><p>We
    use OpenStreetMap to make our website more attractive to users and enable them to more easily find the offices and
    places listed on our web pages. This is lawful under Article 6 paragraph 1 lit. f EU-GDPR.</p><p>Specific details
    about how user data are handled are available on <a rel="noopener noreferrer"

<h3>Storage location and data usage for a specific purpose</h3>
<p>
    We collect, process and store your personal data exclusively internally (usually in the computer center of the TU
    Berlin) only for the purpose for which you have communicated it to us and thus observe the principle of
    purpose-bound data use. Your personal data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent,
    unless this is necessary for the provision of the service or the execution of the contract. The transfer to state
    institutions and authorities requesting information will also only take place within the framework of the legal
    obligations to provide information or if we are obliged to provide information by a court decision.</p><p>We also
    take the University's internal data protection very seriously. Our employees and contracted service providers are
    bound to confidentiality and compliance with data protection law.

    a reason. For this purpose, please contact us at the address given in the imprint. We will be happy to answer any
    further questions you may have about our privacy policy.</p><p>In addition, you have the right to correct, delete,
    restrict and transfer your data.</p><p>You also have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal
    data concerning you that is carried out on the basis of Article 6 paragraph 1 lit.&nbsp;e&nbsp;and f&nbsp;EU-GDPR.

    demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or
    the processing serves the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending legal claims.
