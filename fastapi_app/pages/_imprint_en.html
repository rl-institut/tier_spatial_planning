<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<h4>Online Content</h4>
<p>The content of this website is researched and published with the greatest possible care. Nevertheless, errors may still occur. Please send comments and corrections to the Office of Communication, Events and Alumni.<br>
The publisher is not liable for the currentness, accuracy, completeness, or quality of the information provided. Liability claims against the publisher, which refer to material or non-material damage caused by the use or disuse of the information provided or by the use of incorrect or incomplete information, are excluded in principle, unless there is evidence of willful intent or gross negligence on the part of the publisher.<br>
All offers are subject to change and non-binding. Parts of the pages or the complete content may be changed, supplemented, or partly or completely removed by the publisher without separate announcement.
<h4>References and Links</h4>
<p>
In the case of direct or indirect references to external websites ("hyperlinks") which are outside the publisher's area of responsibility, a liability obligation only comes into force if the publisher is aware of the content and it is technically possible and reasonable for them to prevent use in the case of illegal content.<br>
The publisher hereby expressly declares that at the time the links were created, no illegal content was discernible on the linked pages. The publisher has no influence on the current and future design, content or authorship of the linked pages. Therefore, they hereby expressly distance themselves from all contents of all linked pages that have been changed after the link was created. This statement applies to all links and references made within the author's own website as well as to external entries in guest books, discussion forums, link directories, mailing lists and all other forms of databases set up by the author, whose content can be accessed and changed externally. For illegal, incorrect or incomplete content and in particular for damages resulting from the use or disuse of such information, only the provider of the page to which reference is made is liable, not the person who merely refers to the respective publication via links.<br>
</p>
<h4 id="test">Copyright and Trademark Protection</h4>
<p>The publisher endeavors to observe the copyrights of the images, graphics, sound and video documents, and texts used in all publications; to use images, graphics, sound and video documents, and texts created by the publisher; or to use license-free graphics, sound and video documents, and texts.<br>
All brands and trademarks mentioned within the website and possibly protected by third parties are subject without restriction to the provisions of the applicable trademark law and the ownership rights of the respective registered owners. The fact alone that a trademark appears within a text does not imply that it is not protected by the rights of third parties!<br>
The copyright for published content and objects created by the publisher themselves remains solely with the publisher of the pages. Any duplication, processing, storage or use of objects such as diagrams, sound and video documents, or texts in other electronic or printed publications is not permitted without the author's agreement. This does not apply to copying and downloading for private, scientific and non-commercial use. We expressly permit and welcome the citing of our documents and web pages as well as the linking to our website.

<h4 id="dataPro">Data Protection</h4>

    If the opportunity for the entry of personal or business data (email addresses, name, addresses) is given, the entry of this data is done voluntarily. The use and payment of all services offered is - as far as technically possible and reasonable - also permitted without providing such data or by providing anonymous data or a pseudonym. The use of contact data such as postal addresses, telephone and fax numbers as well as email addresses published in the site credits or comparable information by third parties for the transmission of information not expressly requested is not permitted. We expressly reserve the right to take legal action against the senders of spam mail in the event of violations of this prohibition.
